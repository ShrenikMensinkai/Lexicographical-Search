Problem Statement : Write a program to find the N closest strings (not numbers) for each string in an array. Strictly consider the time and memory complexity while coding.

Command format: program

Example Command: program input_array_file.txt 38

Example: For an input array as [ “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5”, “6” ] and N = 3

Output: The closest 3 items for 1 is 2,3,4 The closest 3 items for 2 is 1,3,4 The closest 3 items for 3 is 2,4,5 The closest 3 items for 4 is 3,5,6 The closest 3 items for 5 is 3,4,6 The closest 3 items for 6 is 3,4,5

Testing Method: Start testing your code on smaller arrays but consider that user can give input in the range of 50,000 items in an array and N being 1000 .

Important Notes:
Use can use basic data structure libraries like maps, lists but not algorithms like Top N. It's not index based Top N
